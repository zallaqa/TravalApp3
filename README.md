Installing

you need the following:
npm install ----> to install all the required dependencies
notice: you may still need to download the nodeomon as a dependency

make your env file with new names and add them to the server with the new names
for example USERNAME1 = //     instead of USERNAME and make sure you do that too when you add the name to the server file.

to get the keys like username and weatherbit key you need to create them yourself and add them with different names
to the env file and still make the changes based on that


Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

npm run test will run jest in the terminal and get you the results
you are free to make more jest testing on your version of the project.


Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

npm run build to get the live version of a new build after you have installed the packages and setup new environment keys and added them to the server functions in a proper way.
